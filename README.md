# Introduction

There are countless other bookmarking services, apps etc. on the
internet. Some are excellent pieces of software and are much better
than firefly. I doubt firefly will ever achieve to being as big as
some of it's alternatives.

I first started thinking of writing something because I wanted to get
comfortable with Flask, MongoDB, pytest and to have an excuse to use
[Tachyons](https://tachyons.io ) CSS library. I decided that it should
be a bookmarking app because I've been looking for a self-hosted
bookmarking web-app with minimal user interface.

Now that it has started shaping up, it is a good time to set a set of
abstract goals or direction for the project.

* Simple user interface.
* Highly configurable.
* Easy to install and upgrade.
* Fast. Should be very fast.
* Should emphasize on self-hosting.
* The code should be well tested.
* Should always be liberal when it comes to adding features that ease
  on organizing our daily digital life.
* Should always be conservataive when it comes to drastically changing
  the user interface.
* Should keep backwards compatibility.
* Should be oriented to tech-savvy and power users.


## TODO

* backup database (with encryption??)
* restore from backup
